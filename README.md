# Welcome to My Portofolio

To demonstrate my skills effectively, I'm embarking on a comprehensive project that involves crafting detailed documentation to support a software house. Alongside this, I've curated a collection of code repositories to showcase my technical expertise.

If you're eager to dive right into some software samples, you can find my highlighted repositories right on my  [homepage](https://github.com/gezielcarvalho), ready for your exploration. Alternatively, you can browse through the numerous repositories listed in my GitHub profile. Just [click here](https://github.com/gezielcarvalho?tab=repositories) to peruse and pick what piques your interest.

For a deeper understanding of the inner workings of a software house, spanning its structure, documentation, DevOps practices, and more, the [wiki in this project](https://github.com/gezielcarvalho/portfolio/wiki) serves as an excellent starting point. Follow along with the accompanying wiki pages to delve into the intricacies of this engaging journey.
