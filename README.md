# Welcome to my portofolio

In order to showcase my skills, I'll write in this project a a comprehensive documentation to support a software house, along with code repositories demonstrating my technical skills.

If you want a direct approach to samples of software, check my featured (pinned) repos at my frontpage or browse my dozens of repositores from the GitHub list. Just click here and suit yourself.

If you want to learn more about a software house, the structure, documentation, devops and more, start from this document and follow along with the wiki pages.
